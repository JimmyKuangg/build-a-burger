# Build-A-Burger

## Background
Build-A-Burger is a game where you work as a short order cook. Tickets will come on a line and your job is to prepare the burgers to the specifications of those tickets. Tickets will become more complex as time goes on. Make sure to keep those customers happy, and don't burn anything.

## Functionality
In Build-A-Burger, users will be able to: 

* Click and drag ingredients
* Keep a score
* Assemble a Burger of any combination
* Have some form of timer on the cooking of the burgers

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
This project is implemented with these technologies:
* Canvas to render the view


## Implementation Timeline
* Friday - Initial setup of the project. Get used to Three.js and how to manipulate meshes, shapes, and rotations. Attempt to render a background and kitchen.

* Saturday - Learn more about Three.js. Render all ingredients to the view.

* Sunday - Figure out the implementation of classes for each ingredient. Work on underlying code for the classes and objects.

* Monday - If there are bugs (more than likely will be), fix them. Ensure all code is working before attempting to render more objects and add more complexity. Work on burger class.

* Tuesday - Add collision and stackability for the burgers on the view. Ensure scores can be updated and that burgers can be sent out.

* Wednesday - Styling the page and making sure everything looks pretty.

* Thursday Morning - Work out any remaining problems and push to Github.
